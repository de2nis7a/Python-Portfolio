# Python-Portfolio
A collection of focused Python algorithms and data structures designed to showcase fundamental and intermediate programming skills in logic and analysis.

# Python Fundamentals and Intermediate Portfolio

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python scripts designed to showcase proficiency in fundamental and intermediate programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), algorithms, data processing, and graphical interaction.

The projects are organized by technical domain to provide demonstrable proof of competency to technical recruiters and hiring managers.

# Repository Structure and Demonstrated Skills

The code is categorized into focused directories, showing a progressive understanding of Python principles:


# Primary Concepts Demonstrated

* [Basics_and_Control_Flow](./Basics_and_Control_Flow)

Basic I/O, arithmetic, conditional logic (if/elif/else), and fundamental loops (for, while).

* [Math_and_Geometric_Calculations](./Math_and_Geometric_Calculations)

Use of the math library for trigonometry, square roots, and solving geometric formulas (e.g., distance, area).

* **/String_and_Data_Formatting**

Advanced string manipulation (slicing, split(), upper()), output formatting, and basic data parsing.

* **/Algorithms_and_Logic**

Implementation of classic algorithms (Fibonacci, coin change), logic puzzles, and simple statistical simulations (random walks, dice rolls).

* **/Object_Oriented_Programming**

OOP Systems: Implementation of classes, properties (@property), inheritance, and composition to model real-world systems (Library, Sales, Student Management, Pizza).

* **/External_Libraries_and_Graphics**

External Dependency: Integration with the graphix library to demonstrate interactive graphics, animation loops, coordinate geometry, and dynamic drawing (e.g., checkerboards, spirals, moving cars).

* **/ Modular_Programming_and_Composition**

Writing clean, modular code using multiple helper functions and composing them to build interactive tools and simple games (e.g., scoring system, eye locator game).

* **/ File_Input_Output_and_Processing**

Reading, writing, and parsing data from external files (.txt) for basic reporting and data cleaning tasks.

# Execution Requirements

To run the scripts in the External_Libraries_and_Graphics folder, the corresponding graphics library (graphix or similar) must be installed.

Data files required for the File_Input_Output_and_Processing scripts are located in the dedicated text_files/ directory.
