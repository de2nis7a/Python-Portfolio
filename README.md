# 🐍 Python-Portfolio
A curated collection of Python algorithms and data structures showcasing fundamental and intermediate programming concepts in logic, algorithms, and software design.

# 💡 Python Fundamentals and Intermediate Portfolio

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python scripts developed to demonstrate proficiency across core programming concepts — from control flow and algorithms to OOP systems and graphical programming.

The codebase is organized by technical domain, offering clear evidence of structured problem-solving and clean code design for technical recruiters and hiring managers.

## 📁 Repository Structure and Demonstrated Skills

Each folder in this portfolio highlights a specific area of Python expertise, progressing from foundational principles to applied programming.

---

### 1. 🧩 [Basics and Control Flow](./Basics_and_Control_Flow)
Demonstrates basic input/output, arithmetic operations, conditional statements (`if` / `elif` / `else`), and iterative loops (`for`, `while`).

---

### 2. 📐 [Math and Geometric Calculations](./Math_and_Geometric_Calculations)
Showcases the use of the `math` library for trigonometric calculations, square roots, and solving geometric problems such as distance and area formulas.

---

### 3. 🧵 [String and Data Formatting](./String_and_Data_Formatting)
Demonstrates advanced string manipulation (`slicing`, `split()`, `upper()`), formatted output, and parsing structured text data.

---

### 4. 🔢 [Algorithms and Logic](./Algorithms_and_Logic)
Implements classic algorithms like Fibonacci sequences and coin change problems, alongside logic-based puzzles and probability simulations (e.g., dice rolls, random walks).

---

### 5. 🧱 [Object-Oriented Programming](./Object_Oriented_Programming)
Features OOP implementations using classes, inheritance, and composition. Projects model real-world systems such as a **Library**, **Sales Manager**, **Student System**, and **Pizza Ordering App**.

---

### 6. 🎨 [External Libraries and Graphics](./External_Libraries_and_Graphics)
Demonstrates integration with external libraries like **Graphix** to create interactive graphics, animations, and coordinate-based drawings (e.g., checkerboards, spirals, or moving cars).

---

### 7. 🧮 [Modular Programming and Composition](./Modular_Programming_and_Composition)
Focuses on clean modular architecture — using helper functions and composition to build interactive tools and games (e.g., scoring systems, eye-tracking mini-games).

---

### 8. 📂 [File Input/Output and Processing](./File_Input_Output_and_Processing)
Covers file reading and writing operations, parsing `.txt` data files, and performing lightweight data processing and reporting.

---

## ⚙️ Execution Requirements

- Some projects require the installation of the **Graphix** (or similar) library to support graphical rendering.  
- Input text files used by `File_Input_Output_and_Processing` scripts are located in the dedicated `text_files/` directory.
